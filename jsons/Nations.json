	To-do:
	Dandelion
	Elysium
	Gestalt
	The Confederacy
	The Wild
	Central State
	Blue Sun

	Dandelion: rethink them to be different-thinking cave people that can make a lot of food, strong individual unique units that suffer from being adjacent to others?
	Elysium: nothing much to add, just fill in blanks and update uniques
	Gestalt: have to build from ground up, original is empty af -> a collective of pre-war scientists who found a way to make a hivemind, units have strength bonus when adjacent to other units
	Confederacy: underground train people, maybe turn them into miner descendants as well?
	The Wild: again, another faction with only a name for them -> turn them into rural tribes, even more 'feral' than Rusters, cheap low tech personnel units and a special ghillie promotion maybe?
	Central State: fill in blanks, update uniques, then see if it needs balancing
	Blue Sun: fill in blanks, update uniques, then see if it needs balancing
